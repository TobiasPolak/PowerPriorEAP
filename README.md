# PowerPriorEAP
Code to accompany the manuscript '_Augmenting treatment arms with external data through propensity-score weighted power-priors: an application in expanded access_'. The manuscript is work in progress and is available through Arxiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01557). 

This repository contains the following scripts for the calculation of the Power Prior Propensity and the Simulation study conducted as part of said manuscript. 

1. [01LoadInstall.R](https://github.com/TobiasPolak/powerprioreap/01LoadInstall.R) - Script to load and install necessary packages
2. [02DataSimulation.R](https://github.com/TobiasPolak/powerprioreap/02DataSimulation.R) - Script to simulate data
3. [03Estimation.R](https://github.com/TobiasPolak/powerprioreap/03Estimation.R) - Script to estimate parameters
4. [04Simulation.R](https://github.com/TobiasPolak/powerprioreap/04Simulation.R) - Script to perform simulations
5. [05RunAnalysis.R](https://github.com/TobiasPolak/powerprioreap/05RunAnalysis.R) - Script to run final analysis to compare methods for the manuscript.
