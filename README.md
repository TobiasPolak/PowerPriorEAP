# PowerPriorEAP
Code to accompany the manuscript '_Augmenting treatment arms with external data through propensity-score weighted power-priors: an application in expanded access_'. The manuscript is work in progress and not publicly available. 

This repository contains the following scripts for the calculation of the Power Prior Propensity and the Simulation study conducted as part of said manuscript. 

1. [01LoadInstall.R](https://github.com/TobiasPolak/powerprioreap/01LoadInstall.R) - Script to load and install necessary packages
2. [02DataSimulation.R](https://github.com/TobiasPolak/powerprioreap/02DataSimulation.R) - Script to simulate data
3. [03Estimation.R](https://github.com/TobiasPolak/powerprioreap/03Estimation.R) - Script to estimate parameters
4. [04Simulation.R](https://github.com/TobiasPolak/powerprioreap/04Simulation.R) - Script to perform simulations
5. [05RunAnalysis.R](https://github.com/TobiasPolak/powerprioreap/05RunAnalysis.R) - Script to run final analysis to compare methods for the manuscript.
